This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
More information is available at http://docs.hdx.rwlabs.org/

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

HDX methodology : HIV prevalence rates reflect the rate of HIV infection in each country's population. Low national prevalence rates can be misleading, however. They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable. Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. For example, improved software was used to model the course of HIV epidemics and their impacts, making full use of information on HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The software explicitly includes the effect of antiretroviral therapy when calculating HIV incidence and models reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy, which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer. The software also allows for changes in urbanization over time - important because prevalence is higher in urban areas and because many countries have seen rapid urbanization over the past two decades. The estimates include plausible bounds, not shown in the Indicator data, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates. The bounds are available at http://data.worldbank.org and from the original source.
